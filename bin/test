# Synopsis:
# Test the track's exercises.
# 
# At a minimum, this file must check if the example/exemplar solution of each 
# Practice/Concept Exercise passes the exercise's tests.
#
# To check this, you usually have to (temporarily) replace the exercise's solution files
# with its exemplar/example files.
#
# If your track uses skipped tests, make sure to (temporarily) enable these tests
# before running the tests.
#
# The path to the solution/example/exemplar files can be found in the exercise's
# .meta/config.json file, or possibly inferred from the exercise's directory name.

# Example:
# ./bin/test

# Verify the Concept Exercises
for concept_exercise_dir in ./exercises/concept/*/; do
    if [ -d $concept_exercise_dir ]; then
        echo "Checking $(basename "${concept_exercise_dir}") exercise..."
        # TODO: run command to verify that the exemplar solution passes the tests
    fi
done

# Verify the Practice Exercises
for practice_exercise_dir in ./exercises/practice/*/; do
    if [ -d $practice_exercise_dir ]; then
        stub="$(basename "${practice_exercise_dir}" | tr - _)"
        echo "Checking ${stub} exercise..."
        # TODO: run command to verify that the example solution passes the tests
        # create new tmp directory
        mkdir temp
        # copy and rename example.v file
        cp "${practice_exercise_dir}.meta/example.v" "temp/${stub}.v"
        # copy test v file
        cp "${practice_exercise_dir}run_test.v" "temp/run_test.v"
        # run tests in tmp directory
        v run temp/run_test.v
        # clear tmp directory
        rm -rf ./temp
    fi
done
