# Instructions append

Your list must also implement the following interface:

- `delete` (delete the first occurrence of a specified value)
- `count` (count the number of items in the list)

The stubs in `linked-list.v` provide the _minimum_ set of interfaces. You may wish to add your own definitions, such as a structure to represent an item in the list.

However, do _not_ use a library to implement this exercise, and do _not_ use an array.
