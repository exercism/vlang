# Tests

To run the tests run the command `v test .` from within the exercise directory.

If you want to see all the tests that were run along with statistics on speed, use `v -stats test .`

For more information on testing in V, please see [the documentation](https://github.com/vlang/v/blob/master/doc/docs.md#testing).
