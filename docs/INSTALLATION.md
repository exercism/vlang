# Installation

## Installing V
Please follow the [instructions in the official documentation](https://github.com/vlang/v/blob/master/README.md#installing-v-from-source) to install V on your machine.

It is highly recommended that you install from source and then follow the [instructions on symlinking](https://github.com/vlang/v/blob/master/README.md#symlinking) to be able to run V anywhere.

## Using an IDE
The best way to use V in an IDE is to use the [VSCodium](https://vscodium.com/) [extension](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=vlanguage.vscode-vlang). There is also support for [Vim](https://github.com/ollykel/v-vim), [Emacs](https://github.com/damon-kwok/v-mode), and [Sublime](https://github.com/elliotchance/vlang-sublime). To see a full list of supported IDEs, see the [V homepage](https://vlang.io/).
