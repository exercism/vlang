# Tests

## Running tests
To run tests for a specific implementation of an exercise, here are the recommended steps:

1. create your implementation in `[SLUG].v`
1. cd to the directory where `[SLUG].v` and `run_test.v` are located
1. run `v -stats test run_test.v`

## Testing in V
For more information on testing in V, refer to the [official docs](https://github.com/vlang/v/blob/master/doc/docs.md#testing)
