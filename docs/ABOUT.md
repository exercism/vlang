# About

[V](https://vlang.io/) is a simple language for building maintainable programs. The syntax is similar to Go, with performance as fast as C.

V is still in beta development, but already very powerful.

With many built-in safety features, V helps your code run no matter what you throw at it: bounds checking, no undefined values, immutable variables by default, Option/Result types and mandatory error checks, and no null.

V is written in V and compiles itself in under a second, and can call C code with no costs. It also has built-in formatting, code profiling, testing, and docs generation.

The official website is [vlang.io](https://vlang.io/) and the docs are all in [this markdown file](https://github.com/vlang/v/blob/master/doc/docs.md).
